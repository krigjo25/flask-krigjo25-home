### Description

####    HTML
####    CSS
####    Javascript
####    Flask

While creating the modal i encounted a challange to store the information which was recieved by the API
I choosed to use SQLite, as there is no need for a huge database or a rational one.

During the connection test with the reposory i found out that i could expect a change in some of the fields in the api, as a consequence of using Github, The only thing i expect in the test_connection, is to get something back which is not an error at this moment
